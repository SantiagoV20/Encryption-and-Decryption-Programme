# 🔐 Encrypter - Encryption and Decryption Programme

This Python-based encryption tool allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom algorithm that combines character shifting and XOR operations with a key.

## 🧠 How It Works

The encryption process shifts each character in the message based on the corresponding character in the key and then applies an XOR operation. Decryption reverses this logic to restore the original message.
